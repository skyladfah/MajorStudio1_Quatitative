<h1>01D Final design, prototype and presentation</h1>

<h2>Refine the project goal</h2>
<p>The goal of "Men rule the world (?)" project is to visually represent data in an accessible and easy-to-understand manner, uncovering the gender gap in political ambition. </p>

<p>It is not about making women the leaders. It is about promoting the idea that men and women should be equally present in participation and leadership in politics. The equal presence of women and their perspective in parliaments is essential to ensure greater responsiveness to citizens’ needs. Because people’s interests and priorities are shaped by their surrounded social, economic and ethnic differences. Female politicians with a different backgrounds can bring overlooked issues (by male politicians) to the table. At the end of the day, it does not matter if it is men or women who run the world.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<h4>Design Elements</h4>

1. Colour Scheme
<p> People often assosiate red with danger and badness. However, this project is a part of SDG Goal 5: <i>Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</i>, which is using a red-orange palette as the goal colour. I tried to over come this perception by saying that red-orange is where we want to be.</p>

2. Seats Visualisation
<p> Each country has a unique political system, including the number of total seats in the parliment. I could have use the same seating plan such as a semi-circle seating to minimize the visual. However, this will throw away the uniqueness of the national identiy. A different seating plans not only represent cultural component of each national identity but also keep the visualisation interesting when comparing multiple system/countries.</p>

3. Sample countries
<ul>
<li> China (top image) = The country where the male population exceeding the female population by more than 30 million</li> 
<li> USA (middle image) = The world's largest national economy and leading global trader</li> 
<li> New Zealand (bottom image) = The country with the world’s youngest female leader at age 37</li> 
</ul>

<p>I struggled a lot with JS and needed to seek help from other students. The challenge is not only building the semi-circle seating plan for America data but also linking several set of information together. For example, these elements must be tied up so that all change once clicked. 

  <li> Seating plan (SVG)
  <li> The previous button
  <li> The next button
  <li> The President
  <li> The amount of Woman
  <li> The amount of Men
  <li> The year

  
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>I started off with coding the most difficult part, which is the America seating plan, the semi-circle. Once all the fuction has been set out, I could not go back and change the design. Overall, the code works but I do not understand it truly. I believe I jumped into it too quickly and did not have time to digest the learning.. </p>

<p>I changed my design several time because I could not code them out.</p>
  
<h2>Next step</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Learn Java Script and d3 </li> 
  <li> Find a proper working process that suits my working style. For example, research > design > code  </li> 
<ul>

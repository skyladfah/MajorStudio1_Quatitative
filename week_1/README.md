<p>Number of seats held by woman in the US national parliaments from 2000-2022 (number)</p>

<p>This pictogram chart represents the number of seats held by women in the US national parliament from 2000 to 2022, measuring in numbers. The concept is to display the total seats available in the US national parliament and highlight the seats that are taken by women. Each icon represents one seat. The idea is to have an adjustable side-bar at the bottom of the chart where users can slide the bar to other years to see the changes in the number of women in the parliament. Ideally, the total seats stay the same while the number of women either decrease or increase. To be even more specific, we can add name and image of each woman inside the icon. </p>

<p>In 2022, there are 435 seats available in the US parliament. However, the question is what’s about the other years such as 10 years ago, were there 435 seats back then? How regularly do seat numbers change over time. </p>

<p>2) Beach litter originating from national land-based sources that ends in ocean in 2021 (tonnes)</p>

<p>This bubble map demonstrates the amount of beach litter originating from national land-based sources that ends in the ocean in 2021, measuring in Tonnes. The concept is to initially group the data into 6 continents; Asia, Europe, South America, North America, Africa, and Oceania. The amount of beach litter represents in transparent circles, displaying over geographic regions. The size are varies depend on the amount of beach litter each continent generated. Users can then click on the continent they are interested to explore and the map zooms in to show deeper data on each country in that chosen continent.</p>

<p>It is interesting to think about the bubble size, especially, with the map can be zoom-in and out. How can we make the bubble size synchronise with it own data, as well as other bubbles’ data? </p>

<p>3) Food waste in 2019 in America, China and Japan (tonnes) </p>

<p>This stack bar graph represents food waste in 2019 in the world leading countries, including America, China and Japan. The data is measured in tonnes, focusing on retail, house hold an out-of consumption food waste. It is interesting to see how these 3 leading countries have different amount of food waste in each sector. For example, there is 73% of house hold food waste in Japan while 51% in China. I am curious to explore why is that. Is there a cultural reason related? Is it the type of food available? </p> 

<p>However, the total food waste in China is extremely higher than in America but the graphs do not really convey that. </p>
